    <!--
    THOCCLAB is a branding project for Perth's custom mechanical keyboard community's first service provider 
    connecting enthusiasts to services such as custom CNC, laser cutting, 3-D printing as well as design and 
    production services for custom cases and keycaps so they can take their desk setup customisation to the next 
    level. THOCCLAB will offer members discounted, in-house laser-cutting, 3-D printing and CNC services as well 
    as access to pre-designed custom cases for common PCBs. 

    Tools:
    - Figma
    - Adobe Photoshop
    - Adobe InDesign
    
    Client:
    The clientele we'll be focusing on will be Australian mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and hobbyists with a 
    particular focus on the clients in WA to deliver high quality products without the immense delays and high 
    cost of shipping that comes with purchasing items internationally. THOCCLAB will also provide local reputable 
    and reliable businesses with the opportunity to connect with these clients through the platform
    
    Concept:
    Clients will be able to upload their own designs and gain feedback from fellow enthusiasts through the forums 
    as well as communicate with the technicians from THOCCLAB to design their own pieces.
    
    This will remove the need for customers to search and reach out to businesses all over the world for services 
    which are not commonly available. THOCCLAB will do the hard part for them and curate a list of reputable and 
    experinced businesses who are familiar with the mechanical keyboard niche and can deliver results we all deserve. 
    
    Project Goals:
    THOCCLAB will aim to bridge the gap between Australian consumers and the plethora of customisation options 
    available in the custom mechanical keyboard community. Reliable, experinced suppliers of niche services which 
    are readily available locally to consumers in the foreign market prove to be very expensive for Australians 
    due to the high cost of shipping and fluctuating currency value as well as being awfully complex to work with 
    due to the time difference which only lengthens communicaton times. THOCCLAB aims to streamline these processes 
    while also providing local businesses to reach more customers and grow.
    
    User Goals: 
    Clients of our service will be looking to purchase mechanical leyboards and their parts as well as design 
    their own parts through uploading custom designs and communicating with local businesses to get their ideas 
    turned into physical objects. 
    
    Suppliers will be designing, uploading and selling their goods and services as well as communicating with 
    customers to provide consultations on uploaded designs, modifying designs with them as well as producing 
    and delivering custom goods.
