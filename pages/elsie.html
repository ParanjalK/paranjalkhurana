    Elsie is a mobile app designed for Curtin University students to easily access a lot of the functions available 
    to them through the OASIS webapp. Elsie also aims to provide quick access to core elements of Blackboard, another 
    learning management system. This project outlines a redesign of Elsie from the purposes it serves to the interface 
    design and layout.

    Tools:
    - Figma
    
    Challenges:
    Comprised of a script typeface logo and various shades of turquoise as the only colours in its interface, 
    the current design doesn't communicate as academic whatsoever. Other functional roadblocks include:
    - Poor hierarchy
    - Lack of contrast
    - Rudimentary interface
    - Interface not indicative of intended purpose
    - Inaccesible fundamental functional elements
    
    Target Audience:
    Students at Curtin University are the only demographic able to access the app but keeping in mind the varying 
    age groups that may contain, we'll steer clear of experimental and/or unconventional interaction patters while designing. 
    
    Project Goals:
    - Good hierarchy
    - Reduce pain-points
    - Establish distinct branding
    - Expand functionality
    - Reduce user need to access OASIS or Blackboard
     
    Proposed Concept:
    Our goal is to rebrand whilst introducing a more academic design language through colour and shape as well as 
    a more professional feel to what is currently a rather misleading brand identity. We aim to expand beyond the 
    current limited selection of services accessible through the app to include most, if not all of the popular 
    functions of the larger OASIS website and Blackboard webapp. Through leveraging various conventions of web and 
    app design, we aim to make the interaction experience far more interesting as well as less frustrating. Elsie's 
    ole purpose is to make the LMS functions available to the students, more accessible which we can further explore 
    to design an app which reduces the students' need to log into the larger LMS sites managed by the university 
    when they are on the go.
